            The Artillery was inspired by a facebook group I found while on the mission that focused on providing missionaries with resources they couldn't access on thier own. 
            This site aims to help dissimenate similar information to any who are looking for it.
            This site is not an extension of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints nor does it officially represent it, this site is purely a one-man passion project.
            There are only two sections right now one helps with an understanding of the Restoration and another covers deeper topics.

            This page answers some questions on more obscure topics. 
            It assumes a basic understanding of the beliefs of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, so be sure to read on them first.
            Besides obscurity, there is little relation between the topics, and as such, they're organized alphabetically.
            The language can be a little advanced too so have a dictionary or Google handy.

            This page focuses on answering questions about the Restoration.
            The gist is that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints believes there was an apostasy and people strayed from true doctrine.
            As such, God called a new prophet to recieve revelation and restore Christ's church to the Earth.
