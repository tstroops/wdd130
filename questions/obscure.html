            Theosis is making someone into a god. 
            Plenty of modern revelation supports this idea and there is some ancient scriptural basis for it in addition to modern revelation.
            Psalms 82 is a common example of scriptures supporting this idea.

            Infinite regression is the belief that God the Father also has a Father. 
            There is little information on this topic, and there's no revelation that directly supports it.
            Everyone has their own opinion on the subject, but this is no place for my personal opinion.
            Many do site the King Follet discourse an a couplet by Lorenzo Snow to support this idea.
            The problem is we possess too little of the King Follet discourse to be able to fully understand what it's actually saying, and very few people using it as evidence of infinite regression have read it.
