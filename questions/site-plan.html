      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The idea for this site came from my missionary service. 
        We found this group on Facebook called the Cavalry. 
        It was designed to help missionaries answer questions using resources they might not have. 
        This site aims to help dissimenate similar information. 
        There are only two sections right now one helps with an understanding of the Restoration and another covers deeper topics.

      </ul>
      <h3>Obscure Topics</h3>
      <p>
        This page aims to cover topics such as infinite regression and theosis. If you don't know what those are, you're in the right place.
        Infinite regression is the belief that God the Father also has a Father. There is little information on this topic, no revelation that directly supports it.
        Theosis is making someone into a god. Plenty of modern revelation supports this idea and there is some ancient scriptural basis for it.

      </ul>
      <h3>Restoration</h3>
      <p>
        Most would say that part of the need for a restoration was that there were no priesthood holders. 
        While generally true this theory fails to account for the Three Nephites and John who held the priesthood and were present on the Earth the whole time. 
        Man closing the door on revelation would be evidence of an apostacy and can be demonstrated with the advent of sola scritura, the belief that the Bible is complete.

      <p>Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

        The plan is to wrap text around photos. The text is a brief intro to the page as well as an additional link to that page.
